## A Pacman Clone using C++ and SDL

A personal project coded during the 1~2 months of a summer break. Although a few things are not exact as the original game (e.g. no bonus fruits), I call it a reasonably faithful reproduction of the original.

The main loop of the game runs on top of Pacman.cpp, and the core game runs on MainGame.cpp.
